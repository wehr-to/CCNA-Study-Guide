## Summary of Machine Learning: 

- Machine Learning: Subset of AI that focuses on enabling computers to automatically learn from data and improve without the need for explicit programming
- Supervised learning: The model is trained on labeled data to make predictions or classification on new data
- Unsupervised learning: The model is trained on labeled data to make predictions or classifications on new data
- Reinforcement learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving penalties or rewards based on its actions
- Deep learning: A specialized subset of machine learning that uses multi latered neural networks to handle large datasets and perform complex tasks
- Predictive AI: uses machine learning to analyze historical data and predict future outcomes or trends, network traffic forecasting, threat detection, predictive maintenance
- Generative AI: Uses machine learning to learn patterns from existing data and create new content, such as text and images, configuration generation, troubleshooting, script generation
