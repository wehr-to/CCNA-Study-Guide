## Cisco SDN Solutions

- SD-Access is Cisco's SDN solution for automating campus LANs.  
- ACI is Cisco's SDN solution for automating data center networks.  
- SD-WAN is Cisco's SDN solution for automating WANs.  

## Cisco SD-Access Architecture

- Cisco TrustSec provides policy control in Cisco SD-Access.  
- LISP provides the control plane of Cisco SD-Access.  
- VXLAN provides the data plane of Cisco SD-Access.

## SDN Fabric Concepts

- In SDN, the fabric is the combination of the overlay and underlay.  
- In SDN, the underlay is the physical network of devices and connections.  
- In SDN, the overlay is the virtual network built on top of the physical network.  

## SDN Architecture Layers

- The Application layer of SDN architecture contains scripts and applications that interact with the SDN controller.  
- The Infrastructure layer of SDN architecture contains the network devices.  
- The Control layer of SDN architecture contains the SDN controller.
