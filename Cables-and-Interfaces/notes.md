Cable Types

UTP CABLES: 
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cables are vulnerable to EMI (electromagnetic interference).
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cables emit a faint signal outside of the cable, which can be detected and copied. (Security Risk)

MultiMode 
MultiMode fiber cables allow multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter the fiberglass core.

Full-Duplex
A Full-Duplex connection allows both devices to send and receive data at the same time.

Ethernet
Ethernet was originally defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983.

Fiber-Optic
Fiber-Optic cables are connected to SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable) transceivers in a router or switch.
