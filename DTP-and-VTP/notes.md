- VTP (VLAN Trunk Protocol) allows you to configure VLANs on a central server switch, and other switches (clients) will synchronize their VLAN database to the server.
- DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows Cisco switches to dynamically determine their interface status (access or trunk) without manual configuration.
- A switchport in dynamic desirable mode will actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco switches.
- A switchport in dynamic auto mode will NOT actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco switches.
- Cisco switches operate in VTP server mode by default.
- Cisco switches operate in VTP version 1 by default.
- DTP is enabled by default on all Cisco switch interfaces.
- interfaces on newer Cisco switches default to switchport mode dynamic auto
- Interfaces on older Cisco switches default to switchport mode dynamic desirable
- VTP clients cannot add/modify/delete VLANs.
- VTP clients will synchronize their VLAN database with a VTP server with a higher revision number.
- VTP servers can add/modify/delete VLANs.
- VTP servers will synchronize their VLAN database with a VTP server with a higher revision number.
- VTP servers will increase the revision number every time a VLAN is added/modified/deleted.
- VTP transparents can add/modify/delete VLANs.
- VTP transparents wonâ€™t synchronize their VLAN database with a VTP server with a higher revision number.
