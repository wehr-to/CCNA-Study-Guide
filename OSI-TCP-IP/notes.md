## Layer Responsibilities

- Q: Which layer of the OSI model defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices?  
  **Layer 1 - Physical Layer**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model detects and corrects Physical layer errors?  
  **Layer 2 - Data Link**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model establishes, manages, and terminates connections between the local and remote applications?  
  **Layer 5 - Session**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model identifies communication partners and synchronizes communication?  
  **Application**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model includes HTTP and HTTPS?  
  **Layer 7 - Application**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model interacts with software applications on a computer?  
  **Layer 7 - Application**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model provides connectivity to end hosts on different networks?  
  **Layer 3 - Network**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model provides host-to-host communication?  
  **Layer 4 - Transport**

> The Transport Layer (Layer 4) is responsible for host-to-host communication because it establishes a reliable (or sometimes unreliable) connection between two devices (hosts) on a network. It ensures data is delivered error-free, in sequence, and without losses or duplications.  
> On the other hand, the Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for packet forwarding, including routing through different routers, and ensures node-to-node delivery. This means it's focused more on getting the packet across different networks, not necessarily managing the session or ensuring complete, ordered delivery.

- Q: Which layer of the OSI model provides logical addressing (IP addresses)?  
  **Layer 3 - Network**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model provides node-to-node connectivity?  
  **Layer 2 - Data Link**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model provides path selection between source and destination?  
  **Layer 3 - Network**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model provides process-to-process communication?  
  **Layer 7 - Application**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model segments and reassembles data for communications between end hosts?  
  **Layer 4 - Transport**  
- Q: Which layer of the OSI model translates between data formats?  
  **Layer 6 - Presentation**

## Network Models

- Q: Which networking model is used in modern day networks?  
  **TCP/IP**  
- Q: Which networking model was developed by the United States Department of Defense?  
  **TCP/IP Suite / TCP/IP Model**

## Layer Interactions

- Q: Interaction between the different OSI layers on the same device is called [...]  
  **Adjacent-layer interaction**  
- Q: Interaction between the same OSI layer on different devices is called [...]  
  **Same-Layer interaction**
